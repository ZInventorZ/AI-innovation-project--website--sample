can you make fixed + slider sight variants allow for additional customisations based on each: slider needs the option to toggle a dot, or ring if lenses are toggled on, if dot or ring is toggled grey out pins and don't save, for all sights add option to add/remove pins, remove pin configuration drop down just put the menu for adding or removing pins, and grey pins out if dot or ring is selected. set a 2026 indoor loadout option that contains the prime ronan, AXCEL driver, and V-TAC arrows, then add outdoor setup and replace V-TACs with the Easton Axis, within sight options add a scope dropdown to change which scope (for sliders) and the scope should save pins, lense, etc. make it save the collective data in format, sight w/ scope add the interchangeable scope to be a toggle.
in equipment bow should have a variable for: tracked arrow count that takes from the score history, what bow was used and fills it in, there should be another for arrows put through with a particular string, that records date of score entered and does that
add an optional # of practice ends to each scored session, that, if you are using target face, can take the picture of target to get groupings, but when you enter actual scoring mode removes them from the face to just show those that mattered to score.
